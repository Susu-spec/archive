## Summary

The internet is not just a collection of web pages and browsers; it is a global network interconnecting millions of computing devices. Some of these devices are traditional, like desktops and laptops, while others are not, like mobile phones, IoT devices, and servers. The internet also serves as an infrastructure offering services-functionalities that enable systems, applications and users to communicate and achieve their goals.

But not all of these services involve the web as we know it. Many are non-web services  operating on protocols and architectutes that most likely, do not rely on HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) but are still incolved in shaping our everyday online experiences. We will explore the structural layers that make computer interactions possible, the architectures that support them, and how they intersect with the web.
