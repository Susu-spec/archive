# Non-Web Services: Outside the Web

The internet is not just a collection of web pages and browsers; it is a global network interconnecting millions of computing devices. Some of these devices are traditional, like desktops and laptops, while others are not, like mobile phones, IoT devices, and servers. The internet also serves as an infrastructure offering services-functionalities that enable systems, applications and users to communicate and achieve their goals.

But not all of these services involve the web as we know it. Many are non-web services  operating on protocols and architectutes that most likely, do not rely on HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) but are still incolved in shaping our everyday online experiences. We will explore the structural layers that make computer interactions possible, the architectures that support them, and how they intersect with the web.


## Internet Protocol Layers: Where Services Begin

Protocols are communication standards that define how data transfer occurs between *systems*.

At the core of the Internet is the *Internet Protocol Stack*, a designed to organize communication into layers.

1. Application Layer: The Application layer is the highest level protocol layer which is responsible for handling communication between end-user systems. These protocols include HTTP, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

2. Transport Layer: Responsible for the data transfer between systems using protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

3. Network Layer: This handles the routing and transfer of data packets, its protocols can be divided into connection-oriented (which require an established connection between two systems to ensure data transfer) and connectionless
